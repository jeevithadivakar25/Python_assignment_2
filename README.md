This repository contains my solutions to the CampusPe Python assignment.

Although this assignment covers basic Python concepts, I am already familiar with intermediate concepts such as recursion, lists, and optimized logic. Therefore, I have applied these concepts where appropriate while still meeting all assignment requirements.
